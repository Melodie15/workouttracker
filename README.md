> AS A user,
  I WANT to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. 
  I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a a workout on a given day. 
  I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
